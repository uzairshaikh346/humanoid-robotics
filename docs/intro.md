# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive educational book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book leverages Spec-Kit Plus methodology and Qwen AI for content generation, deployed to GitHub Pages for global accessibility.

## About Physical AI

Physical AI represents a paradigm where artificial intelligence systems operate within and interact with the physical world. This interdisciplinary field combines robotics, machine learning, computer vision, and control systems to create intelligent agents capable of performing complex tasks in real-world environments.

This book provides both theoretical foundations and practical implementations, with hands-on examples using leading frameworks and platforms.

## Book Structure

The book is organized into progressive modules that build your understanding from fundamentals to advanced applications:

### Module 1: ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)
- Introduction to Physical AI concepts
- ROS 2 architecture and fundamentals
- Communication patterns and message passing
- Building and managing ROS 2 packages
- URDF for robot description

### Module 2: Digital Twin & Simulation
- Introduction to simulation environments
- Gazebo simulation platform
- Sensor simulation techniques
- Advanced simulation scenarios
- Unity visualization for robotics

## Learning Approach

Each chapter follows a structured format designed for optimal learning:

- **Learning Objectives**: Clear goals for what you'll achieve
- **Conceptual Content**: Theoretical foundations with practical context
- **Code Examples**: Real implementable code with explanations
- **Visual Aids**: Diagrams and illustrations to clarify complex concepts
- **Callouts**: Important tips, warnings, and key insights
- **Exercises**: Practical tasks to reinforce learning
- **Key Takeaways**: Summarized critical points

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Graduate students and researchers in robotics and AI
- Engineers developing robotic systems
