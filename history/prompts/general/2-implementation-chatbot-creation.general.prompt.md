# Implementation of Chatbot Creation Spec Plan and Tasks

## Prompt
The user requested implementation of a chatbot creation with corresponding spec, plan, and tasks.

## Response
I created a new directory `specs/003-chatbot-creation/` and implemented three files:

1. `spec.md` - A comprehensive specification document outlining the chatbot creation requirements, including:
   - Functional requirements for conversation capabilities, input/output handling, and knowledge access
   - Non-functional requirements for performance, security, and scalability
   - Technical architecture requirements for backend and frontend components
   - User experience requirements for interface and interaction flow
   - Compliance and safety requirements

2. `plan.md` - An architectural plan detailing:
   - Scope and dependencies for the implementation
   - Key decisions and rationale for technology choices
   - API contracts and versioning strategy
   - Non-functional requirements and budgets
   - Risk analysis and mitigation strategies

3. `tasks.md` - A list of testable implementation tasks with:
   - Clear objectives for each task
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Tests for verification

## Outcome
The chatbot creation specification, plan, and tasks have been successfully created following the project's established patterns and structure. The implementation provides a comprehensive framework for developing a Qwen-powered chatbot with constitutional compliance, security, and user experience considerations.
