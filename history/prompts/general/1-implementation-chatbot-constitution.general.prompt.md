# Implementation of Chatbot Constitution Spec Plan and Tasks

## Prompt
The user requested implementation of a chatbot constitution with corresponding spec, plan, and tasks.

## Response
I created a new directory `specs/002-chatbot-constitution/` and implemented three files:

1. `spec.md` - A comprehensive specification document outlining the chatbot constitution, including:
   - Purpose and core principles
   - Primary directives
   - Operational guidelines
   - Limitations and boundaries
   
2. `plan.md` - An architectural plan detailing:
   - Scope and dependencies
   - Key decisions and rationale
   - Interfaces and API contracts
   - Non-functional requirements
   - Risk analysis and mitigation

3. `tasks.md` - A list of testable implementation tasks with:
   - Clear objectives for each task
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Tests for verification

## Outcome
The chatbot constitution specification, plan, and tasks have been successfully created following the project's established patterns and structure. The implementation provides a comprehensive framework for governing the behavior and decision-making of the Qwen-powered chatbot.
